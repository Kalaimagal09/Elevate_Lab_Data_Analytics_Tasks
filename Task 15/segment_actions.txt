RFM Strategy & Action Plan

1. Champions (High R, High F, High M)

Who: Bought recently, buy often, and spend the most.

Action: Reward them. Offer early access to new products and exclusive "VIP" events. Do not spam them with discounts; they buy anyway.

2. Loyal Customers (Good F, Good M)

Who: Spend good money and buy frequently.

Action: Upsell higher-value products. Ask for reviews/referrals in exchange for loyalty points.

3. At Risk (Low R, Low F)

Who: Haven't purchased in a long time.

Action: "Win-back" campaign. Send aggressive discounts or "We Miss You" emails to reactivate them before they churn completely.
